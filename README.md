A barebones fluid simulator in Bevy (Rust/wgpu game engine) solving the shallow-water equations using the simplified pipe method. Rendering is done with WGSL raytracing.

## Run demo

```bash
cargo run
```

## TODO
### Short-Term
1. Add performance benchmarks metrics and tests for larger fluid simulations.
2. Replace Bevy wgpu rendering pipeline with Vulkan rendering pipeline and measure performance.
3. Move simulation to compute shader and measure performance.

I think these 2 optimizations will allow for larger, more interactive, and more realistic fluid.

### Long-Term
If we get significant performance improvements from Vulkan, we'll port our entire game (a serious commercial Steam release) to a custom Vulkan renderer. We'll open-source it here with more demos and benchmarks like the fluid simulator.

## Misc
If you're curious about the long-winded commit history and the [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) file: I was trying to vibe code this with Claude Code, got confused, and then started coding myself and using more specific prompts. I still like Claude Code, just not for everything ðŸ˜†
